## Defining Python Containers

The `dockerfile` contains instructions to create a Docker image for a Python environment. Here is a brief explanation of
each line:

1. `FROM python:3.10-alpine`: This line specifies the base image for the Docker image. It uses the official Python 3.10
   image based on Alpine Linux, which is a lightweight Linux distribution.
2. `RUN apk add --no-cache util-linux`: This line installs the `util-linux` package using the Alpine package manager (
   `apk`). The `--no-cache` option ensures that no cache is used, reducing the image size. The `util-linux` package
   includes various useful utilities, such as `lsblk`.

This `dockerfile` sets up a minimal Python environment with additional utilities for use in a container.

## Accessing to the Python Container

To access the Python container, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker exec -it <mycontainer> sh
```
